🔥 Task 2: Authentication (Real-World Test)

Now we level up. This is where interns usually panic 😈

📌 Problem Statement

Add JWT-based authentication to your backend.

Users should be able to:

1. Register

2. Login

3. Access a protected route

🛠 Requirements
1️⃣ Update User Schema

Add:

password (String, required, hashed)

🔥 Task 3: Error Handling & API Hardening (Industry Test)

Now we test professional backend maturity.

📌 Problem Statement

Your API is growing. You must centralize error handling and prevent server crashes.

🛠 Requirements

1️⃣ Create a global error handler middleware

Handles:

Invalid MongoDB ObjectId

Duplicate key error

JWT errors

Default server errors

2️⃣ Create an async handler wrapper
So you don’t write try/catch in every route.
